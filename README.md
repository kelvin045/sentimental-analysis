Term Project: Developing a Sentiment Analyzer

With the introduction of e-commerce and wide usage of social media platforms, there is a lot of
user-generated data ranging from current affairs, topical issues, and even product reviews.
Companies and organizations are slowly taking cognizance of the impact of social media
comments on their brands. They are now using sentiment analysis to monitor their brand
reputation across social media platforms and the web in general.
Select a MNC (Multi-National Company) of your choice i.e Amazon, Twitter, IMDB etc and
collect relevant social media messages, for example, Tweets that talk about the company or
better yet any of the products the company offers.
Using the following machine learning algorithms (you are free to add others), develop a
sentiment analyzer and compare their performance (i.e. Accuracy, precision, and recall) in
sentiment analysis.
• Naïve Bayes
• Support Vector Machine
• Logistic Regression
Note: you should be able to validate by accepting a new tweet or message and determine its
sentiment i.e. whether it is positive or negative.
Post your results online by create an account on Github or Kaggle and share the link on e-naz
by the deadline i.e. 28 March 2022.
